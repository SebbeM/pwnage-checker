# Pwnage Checker

This is eventually meant to be a simple program that checks if passwords have been PWNED.
After a provided password has been hashed, the program will try to find the hash among a list of hashed leaked passwords.
It is meant to be used with password files downloaded from [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and perform a binary search on the lines.
